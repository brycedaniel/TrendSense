Week 2

Date: 2/4/2025

Progress:
This week, I focused on further cleaning the data and narrowing my scope to ensure the independent variables are more manageable. All code has been developed, and I am now working on deploying it to Google Cloud Functions.

Problems:
I've encountered several issues with Google Cloud Functions, as the environment is not very forgiving. A significant amount of time has been spent troubleshooting and modifying the code to ensure compatibility. Additionally, I have not received a response from my client.

Plans:
My goal is to have all code fully operational in the cloud by the end of the week, including the integration of AI analysis. I will also develop a strategy to easily adjust weights on key metrics for greater flexibility in analysis.

Hours:
Approximately 20 hours this week


Week 1

Date: 1/20/2025

Progress:
This week, I focused on building combined datasets, cleaning and transforming the data, and creating two testing tables. One table provides a per-article breakdown, while the other aggregates data on a per-day basis from the per-article table. These tables will serve as the foundation for my predictive analysis. Additionally, I reached out to Professor Sonora for guidance but have not received a response yet.

Problems:
I encountered web scraping issues with the Google Functions setup. Although the code worked for about a month, it is no longer functioning as originally designed. Currently, I am running the code manually to gather articles from the past week. I'm also facing challenges with the analysis and modeling stages. I plan to consult John for assistance on these issues.

Plans:
My immediate goal is to refine the tables further to ensure they contain more relevant data. Initial permutation tests using sentiment analysis alone were not statistically significant. To address this, I will begin incorporating large language models (LLMs) to cross-check sentiment and explore how they can be integrated into my code.

Hours:
It was a busy week, with approximately 18 hours spent on this work.
