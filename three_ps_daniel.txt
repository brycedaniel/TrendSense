Hours Worked: 6 hours this week

Week 7
Date: 3/11/2025

Progress:
This week, I primarily focused on completing my dashboard, which is now fully finished. One of the biggest achievements was optimizing the processing power and memory, allowing me to reduce costs to just 1/10th of what they were last week. The system is running efficiently, and I’m satisfied with the overall performance.

Problems:
The only issue I’m currently facing is the gap between the end-of-day data and the next day’s data population. Data is not available until at least one article is published for the next day, which can take up to an hour. However, at this point, I’m okay with this delay and don’t see it as a major problem.

Plans:
Moving forward, I will begin working on the deliverables and transitioning the platform from Google Cloud to a personal server. This migration will help further control costs while maintaining performance.

Hours Worked: 8 hours this week



Week 6
Date: 3/4/2025

Progress:
This week, I successfully completed all coding tasks, and my dashboard is about 90% finished. I’m extremely happy with the results, as everything is running smoothly, and the visualizations are aligning well with my objectives. The integration between Google Cloud Functions and Power BI is working effectively, and the overall system is performing as expected. With most of the technical work complete, I am now shifting my focus toward compiling everything needed for the final deliverables.

Problems:
One major issue is the increasing cost of using Google Cloud, which has risen to around $5 per day due to the high volume of code execution in Google Functions and the heavy query loads in Power BI. While the cloud environment has provided scalability and automation, the cost is becoming unsustainable in the long run. To address this, I plan to migrate the project to my own server when time allows. This transition should help reduce expenses while maintaining performance.

Plans:
As I move forward, my priority will be finalizing the dashboard and optimizing cloud usage where possible. I will begin compiling all required materials for the final deliverables and ensuring everything is well-documented for a smooth transition. Additionally, I will start preparing for the migration to my own server, identifying key components that need to be moved and setting up the necessary infrastructure.

Hours Worked: 15 hours this week


Week 5
Date: 2/25/2025

Progress:
This week, I was able to complete all remaining code, with the exception of my Yahoo News extraction. Everything else is now successfully running in the cloud, ensuring smooth integration and automation across all components. The data pipeline is operating efficiently, and the predictive modeling workflow is fully functional. Cloud-based execution has significantly improved processing speed and reliability, reducing manual intervention.

Problems:
Despite the technical progress, I am still struggling to attract interested clients. Additionally, a portion of my code utilizing the OpenAI API intermittently stalls, likely due to network congestion or API rate limits. The current Google Cloud Function environment has a maximum timeout of 9 minutes, which may not be sufficient for certain processes. I may need to migrate to their new environment with extended execution limits to resolve this issue.

Plans:
I have started developing the dashboard and am pleased with its initial design and functionality. I will continue refining it to ensure it provides clear insights and actionable direction. The goal is to create a visually intuitive interface that highlights key trends and findings. I will also explore alternative solutions for my Yahoo News extraction issue and consider adjustments to mitigate the OpenAI API hangups.

Hours Worked: 10 hours this week


Week 4Date: 2/18/2025

Progress:
This week, I began the predictive modeling phase, testing various models to determine the best fit for accurate results. Initial evaluations suggest that a combination of machine learning techniques may be the most effective approach. I also fine-tuned data preprocessing steps to improve model performance. Additionally, I addressed cloud performance inefficiencies by optimizing function execution times and resource allocation.

Problems:
Client feedback is still pending, which has delayed certain model adjustments and validation steps. Additionally, some models require further tuning to balance accuracy and efficiency, particularly in handling large datasets.

Plans:
Next week, I will finalize model selection and begin testing on unseen data to evaluate performance. I’ll also start drafting the report outlining key findings, methodology, and insights. If client feedback is received, I will incorporate any necessary changes before finalizing the results. Additionally, I will begin integrating the predictive results into my dashboard, ensuring that key metrics and insights are easily accessible and visually interpretable.

Hours:
Approximately 15 hours this week



Week 3

Date: 2/11/2025

Progress:
This week, I successfully deployed the code to Google Cloud Functions after resolving the earlier compatibility issues. All code is now running smoothly in the cloud. The AI analysis component has been integrated, and I’ve completed the final data tables for predictive results, as well as the test and train datasets. Additionally, I’ve developed a framework that allows for dynamic adjustment of key metric weights, enhancing the flexibility of the analysis.

Problems:
While deployment issues were resolved, I ran into minor performance inefficiencies in the cloud environment, which required some optimization. I’m still awaiting feedback from the client, which has delayed progress on final adjustments and validation of the results.

Plans:
Next week, I’ll start working on the predictive modeling phase to identify the model that best suits the data for accurate results. Pending client feedback, I will adjust the model parameters accordingly and prepare a draft report summarizing findings to date.

Hours:
Approximately 22 hours this week


Week 2

Date: 2/4/2025

Progress:
This week, I focused on further cleaning the data and narrowing my scope to ensure the independent variables are more manageable. All code has been developed, and I am now working on deploying it to Google Cloud Functions.

Problems:
I've encountered several issues with Google Cloud Functions, as the environment is not very forgiving. A significant amount of time has been spent troubleshooting and modifying the code to ensure compatibility. Additionally, I have not received a response from my client.

Plans:
My goal is to have all code fully operational in the cloud by the end of the week, including the integration of AI analysis. I will also develop a strategy to easily adjust weights on key metrics for greater flexibility in analysis.

Hours:
Approximately 20 hours this week


Week 1

Date: 1/20/2025

Progress:
This week, I focused on building combined datasets, cleaning and transforming the data, and creating two testing tables. One table provides a per-article breakdown, while the other aggregates data on a per-day basis from the per-article table. These tables will serve as the foundation for my predictive analysis. Additionally, I reached out to Professor Sonora for guidance but have not received a response yet.

Problems:
I encountered web scraping issues with the Google Functions setup. Although the code worked for about a month, it is no longer functioning as originally designed. Currently, I am running the code manually to gather articles from the past week. I'm also facing challenges with the analysis and modeling stages. I plan to consult John for assistance on these issues.

Plans:
My immediate goal is to refine the tables further to ensure they contain more relevant data. Initial permutation tests using sentiment analysis alone were not statistically significant. To address this, I will begin incorporating large language models (LLMs) to cross-check sentiment and explore how they can be integrated into my code.

Hours:
It was a busy week, with approximately 18 hours spent on this work.
